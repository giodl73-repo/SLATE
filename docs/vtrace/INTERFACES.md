# Interfaces

## Scope

Repo: SLATE

Interface type: target (greenfield). Controls SLATE's external and cross-layer boundaries so future work packages cannot change them silently. IF-001..004 restate the `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE.md` public contracts; IF-005..006 add the crate API and CLI introduced in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. None are implemented yet.

## Interface Details

### IF-001: Corpus entry file

Purpose: one education delivery element as a reviewable, scored, labelled, **scale-tagged** record.

Inputs: frontmatter (`id`, `type`, `scale`, `market`, `school_pathway_or_attendance-boundary`, `tier`, `sla`, source rows) + a dimension-score block (DIM-01..13).

Outputs: a `validated`/`held`/`draft` corpus artifact joinable by `id`, filterable by `scale`.

Errors: missing `id`, uncited quantity, or missing `scale` → held (REQ-005); type/scope/scale drift → Scope Keeper finding.

Versioning: frontmatter keys additive; `id` semantics immutable; `scale` from a fixed enum (international/national/regional/local); schema in `corpus/SCHEMA.md` (deferred).

Evidence: future VER-004/016; `proof check .` for doc integrity.

### IF-002: `data/sources.md` registry

Purpose: the single citation registry; every cited quantity resolves here.

Inputs: source entries (id, publisher, dataset, access, cadence).

Outputs: stable source ids referenced by corpus quantities.

Errors: cited quantity with no registry entry → Citation Auditor finding; NCES/EDFacts/CRDC/Census/SEDA/state-report-card proxy used as observed → must be labelled proxy.

Versioning: append/annotate only; ids stable. Evidence: future VER-003.

### IF-003: Rubric version record

Purpose: control the dimension pool and weights as calibration evolves.

Inputs: dimension set (DIM-01..13), weights, calibration rationale.

Outputs: a versioned rubric the corpus scores against.

Errors: retiring/adding a `DIM-*` or changing weights without a version bump → change-control violation. Versioning: explicit version + rationale (REQ-006). Evidence: future VER-006.

### IF-004: `tiers.toml` SLA record

Purpose: control the T1–T4 tier definitions and per-tier SLA terms.

Inputs: tier definitions, SLA terms (access time, capacity, program breadth, outcomes), element tier assignments.

Outputs: a versioned tier/SLA contract used by classification and gap analysis.

Errors: changing a tier/SLA term or an element's tier without a record → change-control violation. Versioning: tier set + SLA terms versioned. Evidence: future VER-014/015.

### IF-005: `slate-network` library API

Purpose: the graph primitive every layer builds on.

Inputs: `School` nodes and `Pathway` edges with attributes and identity, including `capacity_seats` and typed `DemandBasis` (`Surge` or `Baseline`).

Outputs: graph queries — `add_school`, `add_pathway`, `school_count`, `pathway_count`, `degree`, `is_connected`, `has_diverse_path` (redundant pathway/access pathway), and `incident_capacity_seats`.

Errors: typed errors for unknown/duplicate ids and bad input (no panics on expected bad input).

Versioning: semver; breaking public API change is change-control. Evidence: future VER-007.

### IF-006: `slate` CLI

Purpose: orchestrate the pipeline and emit artifacts reproducibly, at a chosen scale.

Inputs: corpus/data paths, subcommands (`corpus`, `score`, `tier-sla`, `gap`), and a `--scale` filter.

Outputs: regenerated corpus/score/tier/gap artifacts with labels, demand basis, and scale preserved.

Errors: non-zero exit + message on missing inputs, missing scale, or gate failure.

Versioning: subcommands/flags additive; output schemas versioned. Evidence: future VER-001.

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| IFQ-001 | Exact corpus frontmatter schema and `corpus/SCHEMA.md` (incl. scale enum). | Defer to first corpus wave. |
| IFQ-002 | CLI output formats (JSON/CSV/markdown) per subcommand. | Defer to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN. |
| IFQ-003 | Whether FLETCH owns acquisition behind IF-006 or a separate adapter. | Defer to intake. |
| IFQ-004 | Whether `--scale` accepts a nested path (international/national/regional/local). | Defer to DEF-005. |
| IFQ-005 | Whether `has_diverse_path` remains valid for pathway/attendance-boundary edges. | Defer to calibration and FIND-003. |

## Role Review Notes

| Role Lens | Interface Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Scope Keeper | IF-001..006 restate or extend controlled contracts; scale is a fixed enum; no scoring/design asserted. | pass |
| Configuration/change-control lens | Every interface has a compatibility rule and change-control trigger. | pass |
| Citation Auditor | IF-002 hardens the citation boundary; proxy-as-observed rule explicit. | pass |
| Educator / Instruction Lead | IF-005 exposes school/pathway connectivity and capacity as typed queries with error handling, not panics; transfer semantics are calibration risk. | pass |

Fixed-point note: no actionable finding required a change; interfaces are consistent with SPEC public contracts and architecture boundaries. No unresolved critical/major finding. Schema, output-format, and scale-nesting details deferred to IFQ-001..005.
