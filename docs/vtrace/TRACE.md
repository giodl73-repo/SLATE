# Trace Matrix

## Scope

Repo: SLATE

VTRACE adoption scope: connect SLATE's accepted requirements to mission needs, CONOPS scenarios,

controlled specification items, future design surfaces, work packages, verification, validation,

and evidence. SLATE is greenfield: design elements, work packages, and evidence are

**planned/deferred**, and this matrix exposes those gaps honestly rather than implying built

surfaces exist.

## Cross-Stage Cost Barriers

| Source Stage | IDs Covered | Downstream Stage | Cost Barriers Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mission needs | NEED-001..008 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Every need drives one or more requirements; NEED-007 → REQ-014/015; NEED-008 → REQ-005/016. |
| Mission constraints | CON-001..007 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Constraints attached where they affect evidence, identity, scope, repo ops, or scale. |
| CONOPS scenarios | OPS-001..007 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Every scenario drives at least one accepted requirement. |
| Requirements | REQ-001..016 | SPEC-001..013 / SPEC-NF-001..003 / IF-001..004 | covered | Specification cost barriers accepted in `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE.md`. |
| Specifications | SPEC-001..013 | `VER-*` / `EVID-*` | planned | Verification IDs defined in `VERIFICATION.md`; evidence is greenfield-pending. |
| Requirements / specs | REQ-* / SPEC-* | `WP-*` | deferred | Work packages are defined in `WORK_PACKAGES.md`; execution remains pending. |

## Unknowns And Deferrals Trace

| ID | Item | Downstream Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEF-001 | Dimension pool definitions + weights. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (pool defined, weights calibrate) / corpus wave | partially closed (pool DIM-01..13 defined; weights deferred) |
| DEF-002 | Staffed-seat/educator/section capacity, surge-vs-baseline basis, and non-fungible program capacity. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (SPEC-SG-02 / SPEC-BL-02 / SPEC-UNK-004) | deferred |
| DEF-003 | Data-source acquisition + cadence. | `data/sources.md` / `VERIFICATION` | deferred |
| DEF-004 | Implementation interfaces (CLI, schema, crates). | `ARCHITECTURE` / `INTERFACES` | closed by ARCH/IF; execution pending |
| DEF-005 | Scale as flat tag vs nested hierarchy. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (SCALE-03) / `INTERFACES` | deferred |
| SPEC-UNK-001 | Cross-scale data availability for DIM-01/02/03/06/07. | data steward | discovery |
| SPEC-UNK-002 | Pathway/attendance-boundary edge semantics for DIM-04 and diverse-path resilience. | education-system planner | accepted transfer risk |
| SPEC-UNK-003 | Single 0-10 score fairness across physical and social dimensions. | equity/outcomes/mobility reviewers | defer to calibration |
| SPEC-UNK-004 | Non-fungible seat/educator/program capacity. | operations reviewer | accept risk (labelled basis) |
| SPEC-UNK-005 | Scale nesting representation. | SLATE maintainer | defer (DEF-005) |

## Honest Gaps (no faked evidence)
- No `VER-*` evidence exists yet; verification methods are named but unrun. The next stage
  (`VERIFICATION.md`) defines `VER-*`; actual `EVID-*` accrue only once implementation work

  packages run.
- Dimension weights, SLA thresholds, scale nesting, pathway-connectivity semantics, single-score fairness, and capacity fungibility are provisional; the trace does not claim calibrated values.
- Non-transferring dimensions are explicitly traceable through REQ-006/008, SPEC-006, SPEC-UNK-002/003/004, and REVIEW findings rather than hidden.

## Role Review Notes

| Role Lens | Trace Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Scope Keeper | Trace links IDs only; asserts no score or design; REQ-016 scale and REQ-008 transfer findings traced. | pass |
| Citation Auditor | No quantities; evidence pointers are future or repo-local. | pass |
| Numeracy Checker | No arithmetic. | pass |
| Requirements-traceability lens | Every accepted REQ maps to a need/scenario and a spec; cost barriers gaps are labelled, not hidden. | pass |
| Operations Officer | REQ-007/REQ-015 trace the demand basis and tier-SLA gating through SPEC-005/SPEC-012. | pass |
| Education-System Planner | NEED-007/008 trace cleanly to REQ-014/015/016 and SPEC-011/012/013; transfer-strain unknowns remain visible. | pass_with_risk |

Fixed-point note: no actionable finding required a change; the matrix's value is exposing the

greenfield and transfer-strain gaps, recorded as `deferred`/`planned`/`accepted risk` rather than fabricated.

No unresolved critical/major finding.
